/* 

Arithmetic operators are used to do the mathematic operations

it is divided into two types based on there function

they are * binary  and  * unary
binary = (operand operator operand )  // example (a+b)
unary =  (  operator operand ) // example (a++)



binary operators

types | meaning             | example
+     | add                 |  a+b
-     | sub                 |  a-b
*     | multiplication      |   a*b             
/     | division            |   a/b
%     | madulo              |   a%b
 


unary operator

types       meaning          example

a++         post increment    a++
a--         post decrement    a--  
++a         pre increment     ++a  
--a         pre  decrement    --a  


difference between post and pre increment or decrement

in post increment or decrement first it print the stored value than increse or decrese it
in pre increment or decrement firsr increment and decrement operator works and then print the stored value
